# Tools

A comprehensive data visualization and comparison tool that supports JSON, YAML, CSV, XML, and text files.

## Features

- **Data Visualizer**: Visualize JSON, YAML, CSV, and XML data as interactive graphs
- **Format Converter**: Convert between different data formats (JSON, YAML, XML, CSV)
- **Type Generator**: Generate TypeScript interfaces, Java classes, and other type definitions
- **File Diff Tool**: Compare text and JSON files with visual highlighting
- **Data Validation**: Validate JSON, YAML, and other data formats

## New: File Diff Tool

The diff tool allows you to:
- Compare two text or JSON files side-by-side
- Visualize differences with color-coded highlighting
- Switch between unified, side-by-side, and split view modes
- Automatically detect file types (JSON vs text)
- Deep analysis of JSON object differences
- Upload files via drag-and-drop or paste content directly

### Usage
1. Navigate to `/tools/diff` or click "Diff Tool" in the navigation
2. Upload files or paste content in the text editors
3. Choose your preferred view mode (side-by-side, unified, or split)
4. View the highlighted differences and analysis
